# Softwar-Programmer-s-best-Practices

Best Practice 1- Keep Reading Existing Software Source Code

Best Practice 2 - Complete your documents before next step
    What you learn today, prepares you for tomorrow!
So, again it is one of the best practices to have documentation as much as possible. Few important documents, 
which will prepare you for future are:

      - Design Approaches
      - Tips and Tricks
      - Special functions, commands and instructions
      - Lessons learnt
      - Peculiar situations
      - Debugging methods
      - Best Practices
      - Anything which can help you in future
      
 Best Practice 3 - Follow the defined standards, don't create it
      A coding standard would fix the rules about various important attributes of the code, few are listed below:

      - File Naming convention
      - Function & Module Naming convention
      - Variable Naming convention
      - History, Indentation, Comments
      - Readability guidelines
      - List of do's and don'ts
      
 Best Practice 4 - Code should be written to be reviewed
 While writing your software code, keep in mind that someone is going to review your code and you will have to face criticism about one or more of the following points but not limited to:

      - Bad coding
      - Not following standard
      - Not keeping performance in mind
      - History, Indentation, Comments are not appropriate.
      - Readability is poor
      - Open files are not closed
      - Allocated memory has not been released
      - Too many global variables.
      - Too much hard coding.
      - Poor error handling.
      - No modularity.
      - Repeated code.
      
   Best Practice 5 - Testing to be followed like a religion
   There is nothing like trust while developing software, no matter how expert or how senior you are in writing source code, you would have to perform testing for each and every change you did in the code.

      - Tight schedule, no compromise.
      - Changed just a comment, still you have to test it.
      - Changed just a variable name, testing has to be done.
      - If you feel lazy...it's too dangerous.
